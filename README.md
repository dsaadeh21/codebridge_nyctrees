Street Tree planting in NYC 
In an effort to grow a ‘greener’ New York City, the New York City Department of Parks and recreation began planting what is referred to as ‘urban forests’ throughout the different neighborhoods/boroughs of NYC. The data analyzed is sourced from reports from the New York City Tree Work Hub, which provided data about street tree planting in several different New York neighborhoods. With this data, we wanted to focus on creating a site that would provide the user with an answer to retrieve the following information: (1) the overall distribution of trees planted in each borough, (2) the status of whether or not the scheduled planting was completed or still pending and (3) provide a visualization of boroughs that are greener based on the number of trees in each borough.The user will be able to use the map to locate boroughs in NYC that are greener versus those that still need more work.
